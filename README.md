# AdventOfCode and Other Coding Tutorials

This repo has (sometimes incomplete/incorrect) solution to code mentoring sessions that I have with some of my students. 

Many of the problem we go through are in things like [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) or simple [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems. 

Sharing publically as reference to my students.
